# taskmanager
Builds tasks for SAS Studio

I am a college student, and built this task manager as a project over the summer. It is in no way complete or bug-free. 

There are many pieces missing from this program, but the ones included work well. 

The end result of this program is XML text, which can be copy-pasted into SAS Studio to generate a task.
