# Task Builder
Builds tasks for SAS Studio
SAS Studio:  http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/foundation/studio.html

Important: Please run in Chrome. The other browsers are not currently supported, but it is something I am working on.

I am a college student, and created this Task Builder as a project over the summer. It is in no way complete or bug-free. 

There are many pieces missing from this program, but the ones included work well. 

The purpose of this program is to allow the user to construct tasks to be used in SAS Studio. Personally, I used the Student Edition of SAS Studio which can be found through the link below:

The end result of this program is XML text. More specifically, CTM, or Common Task Model. This generated code can be copy-pasted into SAS Studio, which in turn can be run within SAS Studio instantly.
